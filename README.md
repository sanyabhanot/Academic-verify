# Abstract

Recently, blockchain technology has gained considerable attention from researchers and practitioners. This is mainly due to its unique features including decentralization, security, reliability, and data integrity. The current centralized educational data management system results in problems like malicious tampering, low cost of diploma fabrication, and high cost of certificate and identity verification. The art of decentralized blockchain technology can be applied to solve these problems and many more. Blockchain provides a creative approach to storing information, executing transactions, conducting tasks, and building trust. In this project, we tried to solve the shortcomings of the existing centralized and manual systems and propose a blockchain-based framework for secure and reliable student's record management.

# Objective

* To reduce the university’s large amount of paper and human work in student information
management.
* To keep track of every academic detail of the student throughout their academic journey
* To offer a model for the academic certificate/degree issuing and verification using blockchain
technology.
* To issue digital certificates gained during online courses/contests/competitions and be verified using
the blockchain.
* To present the certificates online for further reference.
* To help students create an online application portfolio without writing a resume.

# Methodology

* The students send their original documents and additional certificates required for verification to the university.
* Returns a unique hash transaction ID for the verification of the certificate.
* Stores hash address of each person; verifier can see all the certificates listed and verify them individually.
* Also stores extra-curricular certifications, platform ratings, work experiences etc.
* The industries and future employers access the verified credentials by using the transaction id and unique candidate id (hash address).

# Results and Analysis

* **Improved data security** - One of the main benefits of using a blockchain to manage student records is that it can provide a secure and tamper-proof way to store and access this sensitive data.
* **Increased transparency** - With a blockchain-based student management system, all parties involved inthe process would be able to see a complete and accurate record of a student's academic history.
* **Improved accessibility** - Students are able to easily access and share their academic records with anyinstitution that needed them, regardless of where they had previously studied.
* **Degree Validation** - Using blockchain technology can provide certificates to students via a mobile application and students can surely share their credentials with others.
* **Accuracy and integrity** - One of the main benefits of using a blockchain is that it allows for the creation of a tamper-evident record of data.

# Conclusion

The use of blockchain technology in education is a good and right decision. There are four problem descriptions can be resolved with four conclusions:

1. **Diploma counterfeiting**:-The increasing percentage of difficulty in counterfeiting a certificate will increase.

2. **Reduced costs**:-It will be easier and cheaper to verify the authenticity of a candidate's certificate.

3. **Time Efficiency**:- The certificate authenticity verification process will not take long; in a matter of minutes, the verification process can be completed.

4. **Competence of workers**:- The use of blockchain technology produces qualified and competent workers. Of course, it is blockchain technology that makes it difficult to fake a certificate.
   
# Future Scope

* **Streamlined Enrollment and Admission Processes:** Educational institutions can securely share and verify student credentials, transcripts, and other necessary documents, reducing the time and effort required for manual verification. This enhances the efficiency and speed of the enrollment process.

* **Verifier Application‭:** Future ‭ ‬includes adding a ‭ ‬QR ‭ ‬code ‭ ‬scanner ‭ ‬directly into ‭ ‬the application, and the student can present a QR code to the verifier, thus the verification process will be instant without having to manually enter a serial number or passcode if preferred.

* **Personalized Learning Paths and Recommendations:** AI algorithms can analyze student performance data, identify strengths and weaknesses, and offer tailored recommendations for academic or career development. This enables a more individualized and adaptive learning experience.
