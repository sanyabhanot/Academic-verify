# Abstract

Recently, blockchain technology has gained considerable attention from researchers and practitioners. This is mainly due to its unique features including decentralization, security, reliability, and data integrity. The current centralized educational data management system results in problems like malicious tampering, low cost of diploma fabrication, and high cost of certificate and identity verification. The art of decentralized blockchain technology can be applied to solve these problems and many more. Blockchain provides a creative approach to storing information, executing transactions, conducting tasks, and building trust. In this project, we tried to solve the shortcomings of the existing centralized and manual systems and propose a blockchain-based framework for secure and reliable student's record management.

# Objective

*To reduce the universityâ€™s large amount of paper and human work in student information
management.
*To keep track of every academic detail of the student throughout their academic journey
*To offer a model for the academic certificate/degree issuing and verification using blockchain
technology.
*To issue digital certificates gained during online courses/contests/competitions and be verified using
the blockchain.
*To present the certificates online for further reference.
*To help students create an online application portfolio without writing a resume.
